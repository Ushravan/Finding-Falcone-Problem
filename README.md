# Finding-Falcone-Problem
# Geektrust Front End Challenge
**Problem Statement**

Our coding challenges are set in the planet of Lengaburu. After the recent Falicornian war, King Shan has exiled Queen Al Falcone for 15 years.
However, if he finds her before the 15 years are up, she has to go into exile for another 15 years!

King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is hiding in one of six neighbouring planets. In this problem you need to build a UI through
which King Shan can choose the planets to search, and the vehicles to use in Finding Falcone. See more details on planets & vehicles.

Here is the general form to understand easily.

King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing,
Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these
planets.
Your coding problem is to help King Shan find Al Falcone.
